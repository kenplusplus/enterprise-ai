  "text": "  CONVERSATION II Miss Jones, could you tell me more about your first job with hotel marketing concepts? Yes, certainly. I was a marketing consultant, responsible for marketing ten UK hotels. They were all luxury hotels in the leisure sector, all of a very high standard. Which markets were you responsible for?  for Europe and Japan. I see from your resume that you speak Japanese. Have you ever been to Japan? Yes, I have. I spent a month in Japan in 2006. I met all the key people in the tourist industry, the big tour operators and the tourist organizations. As I speak Japanese, I had a very big advantage. Yes, of course. Have you had any contact with Japan in your present job?  Yes, I've had a lot. Cruises have become very popular with the Japanese, both for holidays and for business conferences. In fact, the market for all types of luxury holidays for the Japanese has increased a lot recently. Really? I'm interested to hear more about that, but first tell me, have you ever travelled on a luxury train, the Orient Express, for example?  No, I haven't. But I've traveled on the Glacier Express through Switzerland, and I've traveled across China by train about eight years ago. I love train travel. That's why I'm very interested in this job. Questions 23 to 25 are based on the conversation you have just heard. Question 23. What did the woman do in her first job?  24. What gave the woman an advantage during her business trip in Japan? Why is the woman applying for the new job?",
